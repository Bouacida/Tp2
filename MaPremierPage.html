    <h1 > Virtualisation  </h1>
    <p>
    In computing, <B>virtualisation</B> refers to the act of creating a virtual<I> (rather than actual) </I> version of something .<br>
    This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.<br>
     </p>

     <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <h3><B>Virtualisation at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)level</B></h3>
           <p>Every machine has an instruction set. This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware. Using this instructions software can<br>communicate with hardware.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
           <h3><B>Virtualisation at Operating System (O.S.)level </B></h3>
           <p>In virtualistaion at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S.,application suites, networking systems, etc.<br>
           <ul>
             <li> In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtualisation at Hardware abstraction layer<br>(HAL) level this can take too much time. </li>
             <li>So, to overcome this in Virtualisation at operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machine along with the<br> hardware.<br>  </li>
           </ul>
